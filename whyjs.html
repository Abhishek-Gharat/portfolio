            <p>In an increasingly web-based world, the web page is generally its first impression as well as its first interaction with customers. 
                The frontend developers need to take this into account for a strong front-end development strategy.  </p>
                The attractiveness of the website alone is not sufficient. 
                It should attract a specific type of customer the company wishes and offer exactly what they need right away.
                 Most of the businesses don’t give priority to front-end performance. 
                 The website reflects the business profile just as a first meeting conveys a personality. As it’s said, “A Book is judged by its cover”. <br>
