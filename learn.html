    <P>    Being a developer it is overwhelming to learn multiple languages to build different kinds of applications. 
        Most of the time we need to learn more than one language just to build a single application or to build various applications.
         For the frontend part, you learn a different language and for the backend one a different language. For mobile, you learn a different one, for game development you learn a different one. Every time learning a new language becomes quite confusing or sometimes frustrating for developers… 
        Surely we all want to stick to one language that can perform pretty much any task.</P>

        JavaScript dominates in web development because you have no choice — it’s the native language of the web browser. 
        Outside of the web, JavaScript is up against many language competitors where it’s clearly disadvantaged. For example, in the mobile space, 
        JavaScript has no hope of displacing Java (for Android) and Objective-C/Swift (for iOS).
